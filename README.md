A sample Android application for a restaurant. The Interface has a way to see the menu, find a location near the user, connect through social media, and a way to contact the business owner.
Currently, the app is not completely finished. Improvements to the UI and more functions will be added.

The finished product will have one main activity and several other fragments. This helps with animations in the navigation drawer.
